    "Soccer is an ever-evolving sport, from managers utilizing different formations and players learning new skills to beat defenders and goalkeepers. As defenses and teams learn to adjust to these new tactics, even newer strategies need to be discovered so the offense can continue to have an upper hand. Well, with this changing landscape, a manager may try to play his players differently. For example, what if a defender may be better as an attacker? How does the manager get an idea on what kinds of players may be utilized else where on the field? Or is a player not getting enough time when their on-field performance, though limited, shows potential for stardom? My clustering model will attempt to classify players from the 2025 MLS season into player roles based off their statistics. The numbers will be a combination of base stats and per90 numbers, which are used to provide some fairness for players who may be playing off the bench and do not get as many minutes as the normal starter. The initial dataset is taken from FBRef.com, which is a website that stores statistics from all phases of the game for any player who has made an appearance in the MLS this past regurlar season. There are stats based off shooting, passing, dribbles, defensive actions, and your normal, base stats. Through this process, I will attempt to find the most impactful stats, and based off of those, I will create clusters that make sense off their significant variables and we will see what results it gives based off the players assigned to each cluster. If all goes well, this should answer how players should be used and provide managers and coaching staffs more information to analyze their own teams and help scout their opponents."

    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their features and does not rely on pre-determined labels. It identifies underlying patterns in your data and forms clusters to group your data points together based off these patterns and traits. The goal is for points in each cluster to be more similar to each other than variables in other clusters. One of the most common clustering methods is by using a distance metric, like Euclidean distance, to group variables by similarity to each other, as they should be \"close\" to one another if they are inherently similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means is a popular clustering model and it works by first setting a number of clusters (K number of clusters) and placing these K clusters into random spots. Each data value is then assigned the nearest K, and these groupings are what form our clusters that we need to draw insights from our models. The center of the clusters (the centroid) are determined by the mean value of each data point within that cluster, so they are changing often until all the clusters are stable and all data has grouped in their appropiate clusters. K-Means is an efficient, simple model to use, though it relies heavily upon your K number of clusters, though there are methods used to find the optimal number of clusters, these methods are called the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis, and by using these methods you may find your best number of clusters to analyze.

A positive score means you're better at that category or you are more likely to do it (for example, more likely to score or assist goals). A negative score suggests you are not very good at that part of the game, or maybe you do it often and your numbers are higher than others, but your rate of success may be down. \n",

This cluster will therefore be labeled as an outlier and not impactful. "

    "What do we learn from this? Well, I am not sure it worked, as a player like Paxten Aaronson is far closer to a pure forward than a pure defender. And Walker Zimmerman is a pure defender at Center-Back, and does not usually progress the ball at the level of a box-to-box midfielder. Now, a deeper dive into the players clustered may prove beneficial and could show further if the model was accurate with only a few misses, or if it missed the bigger picture. However, time does not allow for that right now, so it will have to be done in future research/analysis. \n",

    "One suggestion would be to look at the chosen stats used to cluster these players, as they may be skewed for diffent players and an overlap of numbers may be causing players, such as Aaronson, to be completely wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "What I learned from this is that numbers don't always tell the story. If these clusters are accurate, and Walker Zimmerman's numbers suggest he is best as a box-to-box midfielder, than the eye test conflicts with that, and the eye test is sometimes the most important aspect of where to place players. Maybe if he were to transition to a more midfielder role he would excel, but we have no way of knowing that right now. So once again, more time and analysis will need to be given to this project to learn more. "

    "What impact does this have currently? I would say this has a negative impact right now, as it would suggest playing many players out of position, which if used in actual matches, may result in disfunction for a team and they could lose valuable points due to an experiment, of sorts. Therefore, with the current player role suggestions, on the surface, it seems to be potentially detrimental to team success. "
